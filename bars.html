  <p>
    As we are situated at the start of The Valley (as the locals call it), there are many places to go depending on your
    mood. In the order from closest to furthest away from us is a list of places we would recommend for a night out -
    whether it is a quiet one or if you want a big one, The Valley has it covered.
  </p>

  <div>
    <h5>Soapbox</h5>
    <p>
      Soapbox is the closest bar to our building and they boast a range of craft beers. Not always busy, so it's a great
      place for a small night out with friends. Be sure to check out their weekly specials!

    <h5>Proud Henry</h5>
    <p>
      Proud Henry is Corina's favourite place to visit because it's quiet and the atmosphere is beautiful. The staff have a wealth of gin knowledge so ask for a fruity/sour/herbal gin and you won't be disappointed! The back courtyard cancels out the city noise and you can sip your gin under fairy lights, feeling the stress of travelmelt away.

        <h5>Prohibition</h5>
        <p>
          If you want to dance, this is the place you want be. Techno remixes under a hanging light display will rock
          your world. The line may seem long but they get people through pretty quick but the line at the bar is almost
          not worht it.

        <h5>Holey Moley</h5>
        <p>
          Ever wanted to play mini-golf inside a church? Holey Moley has you covered. Two levels of entertainment and
          they make you wear a beret with astro turf if you order food (easier to find you).

        <h5>King Lear's Throne</h5>
        <p>
          We accidentally stumbled into this place because was told by an inebriated person that this was the place to
          be. Cheap drinks, good music, and fun atmosphere makes for a good night out. Make sure you grab a Pickelback
          shot.

        <h5>Savile Row</h5>
        <p>
          This place is a hidden whiskey bar in the middle of the Valley. Located on Ann st behind an orange door, there
          are hundred types of whiskey to choose from. It does get loud and busy as the night goes on so if you were
          hoping to grab a whiskey and a quiet chat, go early. `otherwise it is loud music with no dance floor.

        <p>
          Just like Saville Row, this place is also hidden. Keep an eye out for the blue door and inside you will find a
          cosy bar with a hundred types of gins. Not sure what you are after? Ask the friendly staff for a particular
          flavour and they will give you something extrordinary.

        <h5>Cloudland</h5>
        <p>
          Thursday evening is salsa night so strap on your dancing shoes. Don't feel like dancing? Sit in one of their
          many insta-worthy booths and people watch. This place gets crowded on Saturday nights so be ready to become
          part of the dancing crowd.

        <h5>Woolly Mammoth</h5>
        <p>
          Yes, there is a giant woolly mammoth in the corner and yes you can get some fun pics with it. A large dance
          floor and cheap drinks will ensure you will have a great night out.

      <div>
        <h5>Ric's Bar</h5>
        <p>
          This place is great for a catch up with friends. With plenty of spots to choose from, you really feel like you
          are sitting in some one's backyard having a beer and a chat. The music is loud and there are a fair amount of
          smokers but you're outside. Check out the amazing artwork and the funky decor. Be aware there are two
          entrances to this place so if the line is long in one spot, just go around the corner.

      <div>
        <h5>Retro's</h5>
        <p>
          Step back in time with the greatest hits from the 70's to the early 2000's. Prohibition is fun for techno
          dance music but this place is great if you want to feel part of the crowd with singing and dancing. The DJ is
          quick to change tracks but does a great blend from one song to another. Also, there doesn't seem to be a line
          for the ladies room which is also great.

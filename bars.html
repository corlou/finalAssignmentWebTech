    <p>As we are situated at the start of The Valley (as the locals call it), there are many places to go depending on your mood. In the order from closest to furthest away from us is a list of places we would recommend for a night out - whether it is a quiet one or if you want a big one, The Valley has it covered.</p>

    
    <h2>The Valley</h2>

      <h5>Sabotage</h5>
        <p>
          Sabotage is a bit of a grunge bar, super casual, and has a few pool tables. The Dj usually spins up some old school tunes and there's a small dance space. The back courtyard is mainly for smokers but has good seating for a chat over some beers.
        </p>
        
        

      <h5>Proud Henry</h5>
        <p>
            Proud Henry is Corina's favourite place to visit because it's quiet and the atmosphere is beautiful. The staff have a wealth of gin knowledge so ask for a fruity/sweet/herbal/sour gin and you won't be disappointed! The back courtyard cancels out the city noise and you can sip your gin under fairy lights, feeling the stress of travel melt away.
        </p>
      

      <h5>Tomcat</h5>
        <p>
            Another grunge bar but they sell "Big A$$ Pizzas". This place has more pool tables and a secret door that will take you to a hidden bar called "The Boiler Room".
        </p>
      

      <h5>Prohibition</h5>
        <p>
          If you want to dance, this is the place you want be. Techno remixes under a hanging light display will rock your world. The line may seem long but they get people through pretty quick but the line at the bar is almost not worht it.
        </p> 
      

      <h5>Holey Moley</h5>
        <p>
          Ever wanted to play mini-golf inside a church? Holey Moley has you covered. Two levels of entertainment and they make you wear a beret with astro turf if you order food (easier to find you).
        </p>
      

      <h5>King Lear’s Throne</h5>
        <p></p>
      

      <h5>Hidden Gin Bar</h5>
        <p>
          Just like Saville Row, this place is also hidden. Keep an eye out for the blue door and inside you will find a cosy bar with hundreds of gins. Not sure what you are after? Ask the friendly staff for a particular flavour and they will give you something extrordinary.
        </p>
      

      <h5>Saville Row</h5>
        <p>
          This place is a hidden whiskey bar in the middle of the Valley. Located on Ann st behind an orange door, there are hundreds of whiskey to choose from. It does get loud and busy as the night goes on so if you were hoping to grab a whiskey and a quiet chat, go early.
        </p>
      

      <h5>Press Club</h5>
      

      <h5>Cloudland</h5>
        <p>
          On Thursday evenings, they have salsa night so strap on your dancing shoes. Don't feel like dancing? Sit in one of their many insta-worthy booths and people watch. This place grets crowded on a weekend night, so if personal space is an issue for you, then Ric's bar may be the place for you.
        </p>
      

      <h5>Woolly Mammoth</h5>
      

      <h5>Ric’s Bar</h5>

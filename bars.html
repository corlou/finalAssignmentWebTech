    <p>As we are situated at the start of The Valley (as the locals call it), there are many places to go depending on your mood. In the order from closest to furthest away from us is a list of places we would recommend for a night out - whether it is a quiet one or if you want a big one, The Valley has it covered.</p>

    
    <h2>The Valley</h2>

      <h3>Sabotage</h3>
        <h5>Style: Grunge/Rock</h5>
        <h5>Price:</h5>

        <p>Sabotage is a bit of a grunge bar, super casual, and has a few pool tables. The Dj usually spins up some old school tunes and there's a small dance space. The back courtyard is mainly for smokers but has good seating for a chat over some beers.</p>
        
        

      <h3>Proud Henry</h3>
      <p>Proud Henry is Corina's favourite place to visit because it's quiet and the atmosphere is beautiful. The staff have a wealth of gin knowledge so ask for a fruity/sweet/herbal/sour gin and you won't be disappointed! The back courtyard cancels out the city noise and you can sip your gin under fairy lights, feelign the stress of travel melt away.</p>
      

      <h3>Tomcat</h3>
      <p>Another grunge bar but they sell "Big A$$ Pizzas". This place has more pool tables and a secret door that will take you to a hidden bar called "The Boiler Room".</p>
      

      <h3>Prohibition</h3>
      <p>If you want to dance, this is the place you want be. Techno remixes under a hanging light display will rock your world. The line may seem long but they get people through pretty quick but the line at the bar is almost not worht it.</p> 
      

      <h3>Holey Moley</h3>
      <p>Ever wanted rto play mini-golf inside a church? Holey Moley has you covered. Two levels of entertainment and they make you wear a beret with astro turf if you order food (easier to find you).</p>

        If you are on a strict budget (and most of our guests are), here are a list of places/things to do which are budget and just as fun. Most of them operate all year around too so check with us to see what's on.

      <h5>Flow State</h5>
        <p>
          Grab a spot and layback inside this large cage. It lights up and plays music which helps you take a moment to breathe and relax. It can be very popular in summer with families so grabbing a spot to laydown will be difficult and during wet weather it is off. During the colder season, it is easier to spend more time there but be sure to rug up.

      <h5>Botanical Gardens</h5>
        <p>
          The Botanical Gardens across the river from South Bank are lovely to check out. Be sure to grab a City Cycle bike or Lime scooter and go for a ride. You can get lost there so be sure to stick to the pathways and go during the day. Never really had a problem with mosquitos, but do take aerogaurd and sunscreen. Plently of clear spots for a picnic but watch out for possums, bush turkeys, and ibis birds. They are not dangerous, but they are also not shy either.

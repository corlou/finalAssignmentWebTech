# finalAssignmentWebTech

This assignment was to use HTML, CSS and JS to create a website with a purpose. That purpose is to inform Couch Surfing guests of the wonderful places to visit in Brisbane, recommendations of food, bars, cafes, and how to get around. This site is to hopefully answer the general and common questions asked by guests but of course, they can always ask!

Images will be replaced with ones that I take myself but here is a list of credits for the current ones:

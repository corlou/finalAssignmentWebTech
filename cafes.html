        1. Milkbox Coffee and Tuckshop
      </h5>
      <p>
        This place is conveniently located downstairs and across the road from our building. The prices are a little high but you get fast coffee and a small range of foods to satisfy your hunger. Be aware that they close early on Sundays so don't leave it too late.

        2. Café 63 Plumridge House
      </h5>
      <p>
        A short walk from the apartment but they have a larger range of food to choose from. Dine in or takeaway options are available. Their halloumi burger is a must-try! Do not be fooled about the name Monk and Grind, this is the same place as Cafe 63.

        A little further away but this Wine and Ginoteca bar is branching out into the coffee world. They are closed on Sundays but their coffee is great and their Gin is better. Check out the details for their bar here.

        In the opposite direction of Proud Henry is this funky place. It doubles as a motorcycle shop that sells good coffee. They have large chairs and plenty to choose from on a weekday. Do not be put off by their biker image, these people are lovely.

        5. Mocha Monkeys
      </h5>
      <p>
        This is the best coffee in Brisbane. You go in there and choose your blend from either Mezzo, the Columbian, or Forza. Then pick which way you want it such as cappucino, latte, long black etc. It is recommended to have without sugar as each blend has a unique flavour. The bagels are good but the margarita pizza needs a bit of work.

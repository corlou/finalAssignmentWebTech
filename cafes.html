    <h5>
      Milkbox Coffee and Tuckshop
    </h5>
    <p>
      This place is conveniently located downstairs and across the road from our building. The prices are a little high
      but you get fast coffee and a small range of foods to satisfy your hunger. Be aware that they close early on
      Sundays so don't leave it too late.

        Café 63 Plumridge House
      </h5>
      <p>
        A short walk from the apartment but they have a larger range of food to choose from. Dine in or takeaway options
        are available. Their halloumi burger is a must-try! Do not be fooled about the name Monk and Grind, this is the
        same place as Cafe 63.

          Smoked Garage
        </h5>
        <p>
          In the opposite direction of Proud Henry is this funky place. It doubles as a motorcycle shop that sells good
          coffee. They have large chairs and plenty to choose from on a weekday. Do not be put off by their biker image,
          these people are lovely.

          <h5>
            Mocha Monkees
          </h5>
          <p>
            This is the best coffee in Brisbane. You go in there and choose your blend from either Mezzo, the Columbian,
            or Forza. Then pick which way you want it such as cappucino, latte, long black etc. It is recommended to
            have without sugar as each blend has a unique flavour. The bagels are good but the margarita pizza needs a
            bit of work.

            Daily Planet Cafe
          </h5>
          <p>
            The food is made fresh to order and the coffee is great. Friendly staff and their customer service is
            excellent too. Everything is reasonably priced and a great atmosphere. Their turkish sandwiches are filling
            and healthy too. Would highly recommend this place for their food!

            </h5>
            <p>
              Looking for a quiet spot in Brisbane? This is the place to go. Everything is fresh and the staff are
              lovely. It's a nice spot if you want to read a book while you sip your tea/coffee. Make sure you grab one
              of their cakes as they are tasty.

              </h5>
              <p>
                A very unusual place to eat with some crazy flavours that just seem to work really well. Great coffee, a
                wide variety of food to choose from, and friendly staff certainly make this one of the places you must
                visit.

                <p>
                  A bit out of the way from our place but worth the trip. Death Before Decaf is open 24 hours to meet
                  all your coffee needs. Don't be put off by the biker theme and the heavy metal music, these people
                  really know how to perk you up with a strong brew. Worth the trip.
